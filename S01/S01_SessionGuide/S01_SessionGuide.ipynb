    " - The **typical setting in Python** is creating **new environments for different projects**. Reasons:\n",
    "    - *To avoid conflicts with Python version* - Sometimes the library you want to use in not compatible with your current Python version, so we need to create an environment with the proper Python version.\n",
    "    - *To avoid conflicts between libraries* - Sometimes, at the installation of new libraries, some conflicts can arise with dependencies. That is, one library requieres a specific version of other library to work, but we also have a third library that requieres a different version of the second library to work. This can be mitigated isolating JUST the libraries we need in a separated environment.\n",
    "    - *To reduce the size of the workspace* - Just install what you need. This is specially important if you want to export your environment to another computer."
